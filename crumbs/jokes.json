["Why are pirates such good singers?|They hit the high Cs!","Why is a piano so hard to open?|The keys are on the inside!","What makes music on your head?|A head band!","What kind of music scares balloons?|Pop music!","How do you know when a drummer is at your door?|The knocking speeds up!","What was stolen from the music store?|The lute!","What do you call a sweet potato playing jazz?|A yam session!","Why was the musician arrested?|He was in treble!","What's the difference between a guitar and a fish?|You can't tuna fish!"]
